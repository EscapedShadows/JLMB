# JLMB - Just Let Me Backup

I started JLMB as a fresh take on a backup project I worked on a while ago. There are plenty of backup tools out there, but I wanted to build my own from scratch—mostly for fun and to learn more. The original version had some serious issues with structure and performance, so I decided to rebuild it with a cleaner approach.

Right now, JLMB is still in the early stages of development, so there’s no real functionality yet. The plan is to create a straightforward, reliable tool for managing backups, with a focus on performance and simplicity.

## What’s planned:
- A GUI for those who want to use it visually

- A CLI for those who prefer command-line control

- Local backups with the ability to pick and choose what to back up

- Encryption for keeping data secure

- Restore options to get files back if needed

- Option to upload backups to remote FTP/SFTP servers

- Task scheduling to automate backups in the background
